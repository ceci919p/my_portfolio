              <h1>Kattens Værn</h1>
              <p>
                Kattens Værn is an organization that focuses on helping wild and
                stray cats in Denmark. When we met their representatives from
                their cat shelter in Brøndby, the organization had a lot of
                visiters on their website but struggled to convert it to
                donations and/or adoptions. They wanted our help to simplfy and
                modernize their website so that they could reach the younger
                part of the target group, who they could see were active on
                their social media. . <br />
                <br />
                After several weeks of researching, user testing and creating an
                solution with wordpress, next.js, chakra UI etc. this was our
                suggestion to a solution.

              <h2>The Process</h2>
              <p>
                In this project we had to find a company that wanted a complex
                website. We used "design thinking" as a process method which
                meant we worked in iterations through the different phases of
                the project.

                <br /><br />
                To manage and keep track of the different tasks in our project,
                we held daily SCRUM meetings and used Trello as SCRUM board.
                Throughout the project we used a burndown chart to track our
                progress. <br /><br />
                During our research phase we tested and analyzed the existing
                site with tools such as BMC, SWOT/TOWS, surveys etc. to help
                identify Kattens Værn's problems. This gave us the right
                insights to be able to initiate the ideate phase and develop new
                solutions. Every iteration was based on results from user tests
                and research.

              <h2>Code</h2>

              <p>
                The website was built using WordPress as our backend/database.
                To be able to add an article to a listview e.g. a cat to a list
                of cats ready for adoption, we used posts and the plugin "custom
                fields".
                <br /><br />

                The frontend was built with Next.js which made it possible to
                fetch data from WordPress using getStaticProps which is more
                sustainable compared to other methods. Since the website was
                very complex we used Chakra UI as a component and theme tool.
                This way we could easily implement components such as dropdowns
                and accordians with a consistent design.

                <br /><br />
                Netlify was used as frontend host. Since we were multiple people
                coding on this project, we made git branches and pushed to the
                main branch. This would trigger Netlify to build and update the
                changes to the website/client side. Since we used static site
                generation, which means HTML is generated on build time, netlify
                would only opdate changes this way. Since we wanted employees of
                Kattens Værn to be able to potentially add cats themselves
                through WordPress, we added the plugin "WP Webhooks" which
                triggers netlifly to build everytime there is changes to
                WordPress data.

              <h2>Design</h2>

              <p>
                After our research phase we concluded that the website consisted
                of an overwhelmingly amount of information. The navigation
                itself was very confusing with "hidden pages" and labels that
                didn't always make sense to the target group. The layout of the
                website wasn't consistent and did not comply with the
                conventions which gave an messy and unprofessional vibe. Our
                main focus was to simplfy the IA and modernize the website with
                a new visual ID.
                <br /><br />
                Since this website would consist of many different colorful
                images, the colorpalette was made in neutral colors that didn't
                take attention away from the most important part - the cats. To
                highlight important options such as donation we used a warm pink
                as a secondary color. To catch the eye of the user we created a
                contrast with a cold blue as well.
                <br />
                We also designed a new version of their exisiting logo, which
                worked better on digital screens.
                <br /><br />
                When asking the target group what was most important when
                deciding to donate to an organization, one of the most important
                things was transparency. To bring out more of the feel of
                Kattens Værn and get a look "behind the scenes" we filmed and
                edited video content which introduces the organization and gives
                an insight to their work.
