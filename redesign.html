            <p>
              How can we optimize a Webshop with focus on user friendliness as
              well as attract more customers to increase a small company’s
              sales? This was what this exam project was all about.

              <p>
                The requirements for the task were to find a smaller newly
                started company and make an innovative multimedia solution to
                help increase sales and the user experience for potential
                customers. We worked with “Foxholm”, a small secondhand shop
                based in Østerbro, Copenhagen. When we met the owner, Christina
                Reeves, the Webshop had close to no income. She wanted our help
                to increase online sales and change the visual ID to bring out
                more of her personality to the Webshop. For this project I
                served as SCRUM master and code manager. I also worked on the
                design.

              <h2>Project Planning</h2>

              <p>
                We began with the design and concept of the game. To generate
                ideas, we used mindmap as a method. This resulted in many crazy
                ideas like a game where aliens had to catch cows. However, I
                ended up being inspired by the myth that elephants are afraid of
                mice. In the game you must catch the mice before the elephant
                panics and destroys its beloved home After choosing the concept
                a paper prototype was made and tested by users to improve it
                further.

              <h2>Design</h2>

              <p>
                To ideate on a new solution, we user tested the existing site.
                We found out that the Webshop had too much information at once
                which felt confusing and overwhelming for the user. The focus
                was therefore to make the new design much simpler and user
                friendly using white space, gathering information, and changing
                the navigation of the site. Simple, neutral monochromatic colors
                were used as primary colors to create a minimalistic look. The
                orange is a secondary color and symbolizes the Fox in the
                company name which is based on Christina’s own last name
                “reeves” which means fox. To create contrast and catch the eye
                of the user, we also used blue as a secondary color. To bring
                out more of Christina Reeves’ personality we created video
                content for both social media and the Webshop.

              <h2>The Code</h2>

              <p>
                To plan the code, we used wireframes and mockups. The website
                was built with WordPress. We used the WP theme “Neve” and
                created a child theme to customize it how we wanted to. We
                created the products and buttons for the Webshop with a
                downloaded WP plugin called “Pods”. With this we made custom
                pods with the desired fields/information we wanted to show in
                single view and/or loop view. Lastly, we created Custom Taxonomy
                Pods which was used for the filter buttons seen in loop view.
                The general layout of the Webshop was made using WordPress’ own
                editing tool and “blocks”. The data of the products was
                retrieved using REST API.
