              The elephant’s worst nightmare, the oh-so-dangerous mice, has
              taken over the elephant house in Copenhagen Zoo. You have the task
              of catching all 8 mice before the elephant panics and destroys the
              enclosure. But be careful - the elephant gets mad if you catch
              some of its bird friends. Stay focused - you are the elephant's
              only hope!<br />

              <h2>Code</h2>
              <p>
                In this project I had to create a very simple clicking game
                using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was required that the game
                had a point system where the player could win and lose points
                depending on the game element clicked. After a certain amount of
                time the result of the game should be visualized in either a
                winning or losing screen. In order to build the game, I was
                introduced to the logic behind functions, event listeners,
                if-statements, and arrays. I also recorded my own sounds for the
                game and learned how to implement these. <br />Since this was my
                first-time coding in JavaScript, I planned the code by creating
                an activity diagram and a state machine diagram. The result of
                my work was a game inspired by the classic whack-a-mole arcade
                game. To present this game I created a game website where I used
                my skills in HTML and CSS.

              <h2>Game Concept</h2>

              <p>
                To generate ideas for the concept of the game I created a mind
                map. This resulted in many whacky ideas like aliens catching
                cows. However, I ended up with the theme of elephants being
                afraid of mice. To user test this concept I created a functional
                paper prototype.

              <p>
                The visual elements of the game had to be in a style I had
                chosen myself. I researched different styles and designers and
                found the designer Owen Davey who combines 2D design with
                details which creates a subtle 3D effect. Based on this style I
                created a moodboard and later a styletile to make the final
                design decisions. <br />The game elements were drawn by hand and
                later drawn in Adobe illustrator primarily using geometric
                shapes to recreate the effect of the chosen style.
