              The elefant's worst nightmare, the oh-so-dangerous mice, has taken
              over the elephant house in Copenhagen Zoo. You have the task of
              catching all 8 mice before the elephant panics and destroys the
              enclosure. <br />Time is short - and be aware! The elephant's bird
              friends also lives in the elefant house and will be in the same
              area as the mice - if you catch a bird, the elephant will get
              angry. And don't let you be distracted by the fancy parrot -
              otherwise the caught mice will escape from you!

              <br />Stay focused - you are the elephant's only hope!<br />

              <h2>The Process</h2>
              <p>
                In this project we had to make a very simple game. The
                requirements for the task were that there had to be a point
                system and game elements where some would give points while
                others would take points from the player. The user had to be
                able to win or lose the game depending on a certain number of
                points. A winning screen and a losing screen had to be made to
                make it clear for the player what the result of the game was.
                Lastly, the game should end after a certain amount of time.

              <h2>Concept</h2>

              <p>
                We began with the design and concept of the game. To generate
                ideas, we used mindmap as a method. This resulted in many crazy
                ideas like a game where aliens had to catch cows. However, I
                ended up being inspired by the myth that elephants are afraid of
                mice. In the game you must catch the mice before the elephant
                panics and destroys its beloved home After choosing the concept
                a paper prototype was made and tested by users to improve it
                further.

              <h2>Game Design</h2>

              <p>
                The design of the game had to be in a chosen style and from that
                we had to make moodboard and styletile to make the final design
                decisions. I choose the designer Owen Davey who combines 2D
                design with details which creates a subtle 3D effect. Especially
                the character design is drawn in this style. I started off by
                sketching and drawing by hand and later draw in Adobe
                Illustrator using primarily geometric shapes instead of the pen
                tool.

              <h2>Planning Code</h2>

              <p>
                After designing we had to plan how to code the game. This was
                done by making an activity diagram and a state machine diagram
                which made the coding more manageable.

              <h2>Game Website</h2>

              <p>
                After the game was finished, we had to code a website with
                documentation and a list of assets. The website was planned
                using layout diagrams and was coded using my skills in HTML and
                CSS. Try the game or visit the website to see the result of this
                work.
