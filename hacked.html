            <p>
              Have you ever dreamed of being the administrator of Hogwarts
              School of Witchcraft and Wizardry? I have built a system to help
              you become exactly that – and if you feel adventurous you might
              find some secrets along the way.

              <h2>The Process</h2>
              <p>
                In this project we had to build a system to help administrators
                handle student lists. The requirements for the task were to
                provide an interface to show the student list with filtering and
                sorting options. When clicking on a student a popup window with
                detailed information about each student should be shown. There
                should also be an option to expel students and see a list of
                expelled students. The administrator should be able to make two
                students for each house a prefect and this should show in their
                popup. In addition, some students can join the inquisitorial
                squad based on blood-status. After these requirements were met,
                we had to “hack” the system, inject ourselves to the list and
                make us unable to be expelled. We also had to break the
                inquisitorial squad by removing students shortly after they had
                been added. Finally, we had to mess up the pure-blood algorithm.

              <p>
                Since this project had a lot of requirements, I decided to split
                it up in 4 parts. To plan the code, I made activity diagrams for
                each of the parts.

              <p>
                I started coding the display of the student with filtering,
                sorting, searching and popup window.

              <p>
                The next part was planning and coding how to expel students and
                how to make them prefects. When making the prefect function we
                had to make some rules. Only two students – one girl and one boy
                - from each house could be prefects.

                The third part was planning and then coding how to get the
                blood-status and display them in the popup. In addition, we had
                to make the inquisitorial squad function. Only purebloods could
                be part of this squad, so we had to check the student’s
                blood-status and make a modal warning if the student didn’t meet
                the requirements.

                The final part was the hacking where I made a function called
                hackTheSystem(). The first thing to happen was injecting me to
                the student list. To make sure I couldn’t be expelled I made a
                rule saying that the hacker couldn’t be expelled. In the second
                part I had to randomize the blood-status of pure-bloods and
                making the half- and muggle-bloods listed as pure-bloods.
                Finally, I had to make the inquisitorial squad only work for a
                short amount of time so that the removal was noticeable.

              <h2>Design</h2>

              <p>
                There weren’t many requirements for the visual design other than
                making a theme in the popup for each house. I went with the red,
                blue, green, and yellow colors from the franchise. When
                designing the Hogwarts crest, I used the same colors as the
                popup themes. I based the design of the crest from the movies
                and simplified it removing smaller details and focusing on
                colors, shapes, and shadows of animals. The different house
                crests are drawn in the same style but has a few extra minor
                details. I also designed the search icon which consists of a
                magnifying glass with a feather instead of a handle. The feather
                was to make it look more magical and as if it is hovering in the
                air. To ideate a design for the prefect and inquisitorial squad
                badges I watched the movies and searched for merchandise. The
                result of the research is what the designs are based on – I just
                made my own interpretation of them. I used classical,
                extravagant, and dramatic shapes and details to make it look
                almost antique and match the visual identity of Hogwarts.
